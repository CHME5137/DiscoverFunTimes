Revenue = Max Power * Daily Capacity Payment * (Time Available/24) + Electricity Exported * Electricity Price
        = Max Power * Daily Capacity Payment * (Time Available/24) + Max Power * Time Available * Electricity Price

Alternatives:

Use a BEV for V2G overnight, although power is constrained by:
    1. need to charge vehicle
    2. size of battery
    3. size of connection
    4. requirements for range buffer
    5. distance driven per day

 Use a separate battery:
     1. charge during times of cheap electricity
     2. extra expense of purchasing battery
     3. size of connection is constrained

Max_Power = max(0, min(connection, available_energy / duration)
